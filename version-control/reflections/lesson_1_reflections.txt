从长远来看，能轻松访问文件的整个历史记录将如何提高编程者的效率？

    所有的大型修改操作都能分拆成小的行变动，使得版本回退等操作变得非常方便。

何你认为一些版本控制系统（例如 Git）允许在一次提交中保存多个文件，而其他系统（例如 Google Docs）单独对待每个文件？

    Google Docs 各个文件自身就是一个整体，无需彼此关联。而 Git 中文件彼此结合才能形成完整的程序或类。

如何使用命令 git log 和 git diff 来查看文件的历史记录？

    git log 或者 git log --stat 可以查看历史记录，空格键继续浏览，q 键退出。
    git diff 比较两个版本之间的不同。
